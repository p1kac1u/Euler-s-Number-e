# Euler-s-Number-e
Calculate e upto the number of digits and iterations you want.

I've seen people around calculating digits of Pi. There are a lot of formulae for calculating pi. For instance- Ramanujan Pi Formulae, Chudnovsky Algorithm, Archimedes Formula etc. e has it's own MacLaurin Series expanded simple formula that I implemented in Python. You will be able to calculate as many digits and iterations of e you want with the e-forever.py. When you run the e-forever.py, you just enter the number of digits and iterations as you wish and a new file will be created named digits_of_e.txt. This .txt file will have your digits of e.

You have to enter the iteration number and number of digits for calculation in e.py.You will be presented with the iteration number, e and the relative percentage error with e.py.

Question: Do you think I can break the current world record of calculating most digits of e with e-forever.py?
Answer: Maybe!
