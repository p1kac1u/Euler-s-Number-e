# Euler-s-Number-e
Calculate e upto the number of digits and iterations you want.

I've seen people around calculating digits of Pi. e has it's own MacLaurin Series expanded simple formula that I implemented in Python. You will be able to calculate as many digits and iterations of e you want with the e-forever.py. When you run the e-forever.py, you just enter the number of digits and iterations as you wish and a new file will be created named digits_of_e.txt. This .txt file will have your digits of e.

You will be presented with the iteration number, e and the relative percentage error with e.py.

Question: Do you think I can break the current world record of calculating most digits of e with e-forever.py?
Answer: Maybe!
