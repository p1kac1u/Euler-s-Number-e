# Euler-s-Number-e
Calculate e upto the number of digits and iterations you want.

I've seen people around calculating digits of Pi. They use a lot of formulas. e has it's simple formula that I implemented in Python. You will be able to calculate as many digits and iterations of e you want with the e-forever.py. You will be presented with the iteration number, e and the relative percentage error with e.py.

Question: Do you think I can break the current world record of calculating most digits of e with e-forever.py?
Answer: Answer it!
