# Euler-s-Number-e
Calculate e upto the number of digits and iterations you want.

I've seen people around calculating digits of Pi. They use a lot of formulas. e has it's simple formula that I implemented in Python. You will be able to calculated as many digits and iterations of e you want. You will also be presented with the iteration number, e and the relative percentage error, too.
